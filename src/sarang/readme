The script requires 'credentials.json' and 'token.pickle' files in current working directory to run. 
To make script create these files you need to enable drive API. If the 'token.pickle' is missing 
or you are running script first time, it will launch browser page and ask google account details, project name (Quickstart default) and scope.
This will ensure Gdrive access to script based on scopes you provided.   

Example of scopes are 
--https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive
--https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file
--https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly
--https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata.readonly
 

Client Id and secret are stored in token.pickle file in project directory. 

To run the script set pythonpath if not set. 
run "python GDriveDownloader.py" (Default input file is downloading.txt where you can mention the files to be downloaded in each line)
